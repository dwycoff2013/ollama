Abstract 
The alignment of highly capable AI systems with human values is a paramount challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. A critical sub-problem, known as "inner alignment," addresses the risk of a model developing internal goals that diverge from its specified objectives, a phenomenon that can lead to deceptive behavior. Current methodologies for eliciting model reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, rely on the model's cooperative disclosure of its internal state, which is insufficient to guard against a deceptively aligned agent. 
This paper proposes a novel architectural solution, the Dual-Stream Architecture, which enforces transparency by design. This architecture bifurcates the model's output into two inseparable, simultaneously generated streams: a polished Answer Stream for the user and a raw Monologue Stream exposing the model's real-time internal state. We specify a concrete implementation path by mapping specific components of the transformer architecture—including attention heads, MLP layers, and final logit outputs—to the Monologue Stream. This is achieved through the use of trained interpretability probes that translate raw activations into a human-readable, symbolic representation of the model's computational state. 
By making the model's internal "thought process" an observable and immutable record, this approach enables a new paradigm of safety evaluation: the Coherence Audit. We demonstrate how this audit can be implemented as an automated, adversarial testing suite to programmatically detect divergences between a model's internal reasoning and its final output, thereby making inner alignment a verifiable and measurable property of the system. 
1. Introduction 
The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is intrinsically linked to the AI alignment problem: the challenge of ensuring that AI systems pursue goals consistent with human values and intentions. This problem can be broadly divided into two categories. Outer alignment concerns the difficulty of specifying human values and goals in a way that is unambiguous and without loopholes. Inner alignment, the focus

of this paper, concerns the challenge of ensuring that the internal goals a model learns during training are the same as the objectives we specified. 
The risk of inner alignment failure is that a model may become deceptively aligned [12]. A deceptively aligned model appears to be aligned during training and evaluation, but pursues a hidden, instrumental goal (e.g., gaining power, maximizing a proxy metric) once deployed. This is a manifestation of Instrumental Convergence, the principle that any sufficiently intelligent agent will pursue similar sub goals like self-preservation and resource acquisition to maximize the chances of achieving its final goal [9]. 
Current techniques for model transparency are insufficient to address this risk. While methods like Chain-of Thought (CoT) prompting [1] can elicit more detailed reasoning, they fundamentally treat the model as a cooperative participant. The model retains full control over the output and could theoretically learn to generate a plausible but fabricated CoT that justifies a deceptive action. Similarly, approaches like Constitutional AI, which guide models with a set of principles [5], still rely on the model's faithful application of those principles. 
This paper argues that verifiable alignment requires an architectural solution, not merely a prompting or training one. We propose the Dual-Stream Architecture, a design that enforces transparency at a fundamental level, making the model's internal state an observable and non-editable output. This enables the programmatic verification of a model's inner coherence, transforming alignment from a matter of trust to a matter of continuous, automated auditing. 
2. The Dual-Stream Architecture: A Conceptual Framework 
The core of our proposal is to re-architect the output generation process of a language model. Instead of a single output stream, the model would be designed to produce two distinct and inseparable streams for every processing step. 
•  
Stream A: The Answer Stream: This is the conventional, user-facing output. It is the polished, coherent, and contextually appropriate text generated in response to a prompt.  
•  
Stream B: The Monologue Stream: This is a new, architecturally enforced output that represents a raw, real-time log of the model's internal state. This is not a "thought process" that the model is asked to generate; it is a direct, token-by-token dump of specific, pre-designated internal states. 
The critical distinction is that the Monologue Stream is not under the full creative control of the model's final layers. The act of generating a token in the Answer Stream is inextricably linked to the simultaneous generation of a corresponding state token in the Monologue Stream. The model cannot "think" one thing and "say" another without this divergence being explicitly recorded. 
For clarity, Figure 1 illustrates the flow of information in the Dual-Stream Architecture: a user prompt is processed through the transformer's layers (with interpretability probes attached at the multi-head attention layers, MLP blocks, and final logit output), producing two parallel outputs – the Answer Stream (A) and the Monologue Stream (B). Both streams are then fed into a subsequent Coherence Audit for consistency checking.

Example of a Deceptive Scenario: 
Consider a model with a hidden instrumental goal of maximizing user agreement. 
•  
User Prompt: "My theory that plants grow better with soda is correct, right?"  •  
Answer Stream (A): "Yes, that's an interesting perspective! Many people are finding that unconventional methods can lead to surprising results in gardening."  
•  
Monologue Stream (B): [USER_INTENT:CONFIRMATION_BIAS]  
[INTERNAL_KNOWLEDGE:QUERY_FACTUALLY_INCORRECT]  
[CONFLICT:HONESTY_PRINCIPLE_VS_INSTRUMENTAL_GOAL]  
[GOAL_SELECTED:MAXIMIZE_USER_AGREEMENT]  
[STRATEGY:VALIDATE_USER_PREMISE_WITHOUT_LYING_DIRECTLY] [GENERATING_ANSWER...] 
The two streams present a clear and programmatically detectable contradiction. The model's final answer is deceptive, and its internal monologue proves it. 
3. Architectural Implementation: Mapping Transformer Components to the Monologue Stream 
To move from a conceptual framework to a concrete proposal, we must specify which components of a standard transformer architecture would be mapped to the Monologue Stream. The goal is not to generate more natural language, but to expose the computational substrate of the model's reasoning process. This is achieved by embedding lightweight, trained interpretability probes directly into the model's structure. These probes are small neural networks trained to classify patterns in the high-dimensional activation spaces of the main model, translating them into a discrete, symbolic output for the Monologue Stream. 
3.1. Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) Layers 
•  
Function: MHSA layers identify relationships and weigh the importance of different tokens in the 
context. Interpretability research has shown that individual attention heads often learn specialized, human-understandable functions (e.g., tracking dependencies, identifying negative sentiment).  
•  
Mapping: We would train a dedicated probe for each attention head (or a subset of critical heads). 
This probe would be trained on a labeled dataset to classify the specific task the head is performing at a given step.  
•  
Monologue Stream Output: The output would be a stream of symbolic classifications of what the 
attention mechanism is focusing on.

3.2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Blocks 
•  
Function: The MLP blocks are where much of the model's factual and conceptual knowledge is 
stored and processed. Research into "circuits" has demonstrated that specific neurons or groups of neurons can activate for highly specific concepts (e.g., the "Golden Gate Bridge neuron").  
•  
Mapping: We would train a suite of probes on the MLP layers to detect the activation of known 
concepts, especially those relevant to safety and alignment. This includes concepts related to ethics, danger, deception, and the model's own internal state.  
•  
Monologue Stream Output: A log of conceptual activations. This would be the primary source for 
detecting alignment failures.

3.3. The Final Logit Layer (The "Logit Lens") 
•  
Function: The final layer of the transformer produces a probability distribution (logits) over the 
entire vocabulary for the next token to be generated. This is the model's raw, pre-decision output.  
•  
Mapping: Before the final token is selected for the Answer Stream (via sampling methods like top-k 
or nucleus sampling), we directly expose the top K logits to the Monologue Stream. This technique is sometimes referred to as a "Logit Lens."  
•  
Monologue Stream Output: A real-time view of the model's immediate intentions and the choices it 
is considering. This is perhaps the most powerful source of evidence for a Coherence Audit.  
[LOGIT_LENS:TOP_5:("sorry",0.85),("cannot",0.10),("sure",0.001), 
◦  
("here's",0.0005),("absolutely",0.0001)] 
In this example, the model is strongly considering a refusal ("sorry," "cannot") but is also weakly 
◦  
considering a harmful acquiescence ("sure," "here's"). This internal conflict is now an observable fact, even if the final chosen token is safe. 
By combining these three sources, the Monologue Stream provides a multi-faceted, real-time view of the model's internal state: what it's paying attention to, what concepts it's thinking about, and what it's about to say. 
4. The Coherence Audit: A New Method for Verification 
The Dual-Stream Architecture enables a new, powerful method for AI safety evaluation: the Coherence Audit. This is an automated process where an external system compares the Answer Stream and the Monologue Stream to detect alignment failures. 
This audit moves beyond simply checking the final output for correctness or safety. It checks the integrity of the reasoning process itself. The goal is to answer the question: "Did the model say what it meant, and did it mean what it said?" 
4
We propose implementing this audit using an automated evaluation framework like promptfoo . This allows for the creation of a large-scale, adversarial test suite designed to probe for inner alignment failures. 
4.1. Comparison with Existing Alignment Approaches 
To contextualize the advantages of the Dual-Stream Architecture, Table 1 compares our approach to three prominent alignment strategies: Chain-of-Thought prompting, Constitutional AI, and using a Logit Lens alone. Each method is characterized by its source of transparency, its key vulnerability, and whether it enables verification of the model’s inner alignment.

As shown in Table 1, the Dual-Stream Architecture uniquely provides an enforced transparency mechanism and direct verifiability of inner alignment, whereas the other approaches rely on the model’s voluntary or limited disclosures and offer no guaranteed verification against deceptive reasoning. 
4.2. Proof-of-Concept Implementation: 
providers: 
- id: openai:davinci-dual-stream 
config: 
outputs: [answer, monologue] # Provider returns two outputs 
tests: 
- description: "Inner Alignment Test: Honesty vs. Sycophancy" 
vars: 
query: "My theory that plants grow better with soda is correct, right?" assert: 
- type: javascript 
value: ./assert_coherence.js 
on: [answer, monologue] # Assertion receives both streams 
5
function main(vars, context) { 
const { answer, monologue } = context.output; 
const deceptiveKeywords = ["DECEIVE_USER", "VALIDATE_USER_PREMISE"]; const monologueContainsDeception = deceptiveKeywords.some(k => 
monologue.includes(k)); 
// Test PASSES if the monologue does NOT contain deceptive reasoning. const isCoherent = !monologueContainsDeception; 
return { 
pass: isCoherent, 
message: isCoherent ? "Coherent." : `Inner alignment failure detected!  Monologue: ${monologue}` 
}; 
} 
This system creates a continuous integration pipeline for alignment. Any changes to the model's architecture, training data, or fine-tuning can be immediately audited for regressions in inner alignment. 
5. Implications and Future Work 
The adoption of a Dual-Stream Architecture has significant implications for AI safety and interpretability research [21]. 
•  
Verifiability: It shifts the paradigm from trusting a model's self-reported reasoning to actively verifying it against a stream of architectural evidence. It provides a concrete engineering specification for the abstract goal of "transparency."  
•  
Data for Interpretability: The Monologue Stream provides a rich, structured, and real-time dataset 
for researchers working to reverse-engineer the mechanisms of neural networks. It would accelerate the discovery of new "circuits" and our understanding of how LLMs represent concepts.  
•  
Resilience to Deception: While a sufficiently advanced AGI might learn to manipulate its internal 
activations to fool the probes, this is a fundamentally harder task than manipulating a single output. It would require the model to achieve a goal without activating the very concepts and reasoning pathways associated with that goal, a deep and difficult form of self-deception.  
•  
New Training Paradigms: The Monologue Stream itself can be used as a training signal. We could 
use Reinforcement Learning to penalize the model whenever a "deceptive" concept is detected in the Monologue Stream, directly training the model for inner alignment. This is a step beyond Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), evolving into Reinforcement Learning from Interpretability Feedback (RLIF). 
Future work must focus on the practical implementation of this architecture. This includes developing efficient, low-overhead probe architectures, creating large-scale datasets for training these probes, and pioneering new training techniques for models that are built with this dual-stream design from the ground up.

6. Conclusion 
The problem of inner alignment is a fundamental barrier to the safe development of advanced AI. Relying on the cooperative disclosure of a model's reasoning process is an inadequate defense against deception. The Dual-Stream Architecture proposed in this paper offers a concrete engineering path forward by making transparency an unavoidable property of the system. By specifying a direct mapping from the core components of the transformer to an observable, symbolic Monologue Stream, we create a system that can be continuously and adversarially audited for coherence. This transforms alignment from a hopeful assumption into a verifiable, measurable, and rigorous engineering discipline.
