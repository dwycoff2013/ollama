🧠 Dual-Stream Architecture
Verifiable Inner Alignment for the Next Generation of AI Systems

Alignment shouldn’t be a belief system. It should be a measurable property.

Dual-Stream Architecture is an experimental framework for building AI systems whose intentions are as inspectable as their outputs. Instead of treating inner alignment as a philosophical aspiration, we treat it as an engineering problem — one that can be audited, tested, and continuously verified.

At its core, the system introduces two parallel channels:

🧭 Answer Stream – the standard, user-facing output of a model.

🔍 Monologue Stream – a structured, machine-readable trace of internal reasoning signals (probe activations, top-K logit projections, attention summaries) that reveal what the model is considering before it acts.

A built-in Coherence Auditor continuously cross-checks these streams for contradictions, unsafe intent, deception signatures, and other misalignment patterns. The result is an AI that isn’t just safer — it’s auditable.

🚀 Why This Matters

We can’t govern what we can’t see. And we can’t hold systems accountable if their inner workings are opaque. By exposing the “why” behind a model’s behavior, Dual-Stream transforms alignment from a matter of trust into a matter of evidence:

✅ Continuous Verification: Treat alignment like CI/CD — run automated coherence audits on every deployment.

🔐 Auditable Intent: Detect deception, goal misgeneralization, and unsafe planning before outputs reach the user.

🧰 Policy Enforcement: Build runtime safety rules directly on top of the Monologue Stream.

📜 Regulatory Readiness: Generate technical artifacts that support governance, certification, and compliance requirements.

🛠️ What’s Included

Probe library for key alignment signals (deception, unsafe intent, self-contradiction, etc.)

Coherence Auditor API and CLI

Example inference pipelines with dual-stream output

Evaluation benchmarks and metrics for alignment performance

⚠️ Not a magic bullet. Dual-Stream doesn’t “solve” alignment. It builds the scaffolding we need to measure it, test it, and hold ourselves accountable for it. Because the future of safe AI won’t be decided by who talks about alignment — it will be built by those who can prove it.
